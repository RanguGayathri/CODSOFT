                <h2>Rangu Gayathri</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Gayathri, a passionate Computer Science student in my final year.
                     Since the outset of my academic journey, web development has captivated me. 
                     From the intricate logic behind each line of code to the satisfaction of seeing a fully realized website come to life,
                      I've been enamored with the whole process. Over the past few years, I've dedicated countless hours to honing my skills,
                       keeping abreast of the latest technologies and trends in the web development world. This portfolio showcases a culmination of my endeavors, 
                       projects that I've poured my heart into, and a testament to my commitment to the craft. As I prepare to transition from academia to the professional world, 
                       I'm eager to bring my passion and expertise to innovative projects and collaborations. Dive in, explore my work, and let's connect!</p>

            <h1 class="headings">Website Design</h1>
            <p>Web design is more than just crafting visually appealing layouts;
                 it's about creating intuitive user experiences, weaving stories through design,
                  and building bridges between brands and their audiences. In each project I undertake,
                  I strive to blend form and function seamlessly</p>

            <h1 class="headings">UX/UI <br>Design</h1>
            <p>In the realm of UX/UI design, 
                I believe that understanding and empathy are the heartbeats of innovation. 
                It's about immersing oneself in the user's world to craft interfaces that feel not just intuitive but also instinctual.
                 Every touchpoint, transition, and trope is a carefully considered step in a journey I design to be both enjoyable and efficient. 
                 To me, UX/UI is not merely about aesthetics</p>

            <h1 class="headings">Digital Marketing</h1>
            <p>Digital marketing, in its essence, 
                is the art and science of telling compelling stories in the digital realm. 
                It's about reaching the right audience, at the right moment, with the right message. 
                Leveraging data-driven insights and creative strategies, I aim to bridge the gap between brands and their target audiences. 
                In a constantly evolving digital landscape, I remain agile and adaptive</p>
